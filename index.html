                            On 07 OCTOBER 2023, Hamas, the Palestinian terrorist group based in the Gaza Strip, began a devastating and coordinated attack that shook southern and central Israel. The attack began at approximately 0630 (UTC+03) when Hamas launched a massive rocket barrage targeting civilian areas. Simultaneously, the terrorists initiated infiltration operations, breaching the communities surrounding the Gaza Strip. This brazen assault led to violent confrontations with Israeli residents, law enforcement, and the Israel Defense Forces.

                            The consequences of this attack are ongoing. As of the most recent estimates, over <span class="num_bold">1,200</span> Israelis have lost their lives, and approximately <span class="num_bold">7,771</span> others have been wounded, marking one of the deadliest acts of terror in recent history. In addition to casualties, there were at least <span class="num_bold">242</span> hostages taken by the terror organization, <span class="num_bold">30</span> of whom were children. Since then, <span class="num_bold">114</span> hostages have been released, and <span class="num_bold">139</span> hostages are still in Hamas captivity. This shocking event has left a profound impact on the nation, with families mourning the loss of their loved ones and communities grappling with how to respond.

                            In response to these grave developments, the State of Israel officially declared war, the first time the state has done so since 1973. The military launched Operation Swords of Iron (Hebrew: מבצע חרבות ברזל). This military operation is aimed at countering the threat posed by the terrorist organization Hamas. It represents a decisive effort by Israel to safeguard the security and well-being of its citizens and to address the challenges posed by extremist elements in the region.
